# Fiji_MaskRCNN

A Fiji plugin for [Mask RCNN semantic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).

The trained model is generated using [this Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) of Mask RCNN.

See [here](training/) about the training part.

## Status

The current model has been trained to detect microtubules but new models can be easily trained to detect any objects.

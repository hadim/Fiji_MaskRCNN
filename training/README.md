# Mask RCNN Training

It is used to detect microtubules on microscopy images. The training dataset is automatically simulated with the [`simuscope`](https://github.com/hadim/simuscope) library.

See the [notebooks](Notebooks/) to know more about training and model distribution.

## Usage

- All the dependencies for training are in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).
- It is strongly suggested to use the [Python distribution Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) to install the dependencies.
